## Binary tree made in C# and .Net 6 (Console) in the VS community 2022 

## Learn the implemented logic of a binary tree data structure made in C#. Insert, query and delete data (integers).

Project requested by professor Ikaro Campos, who currently (02/2023) teaches at [Instituto Federal da Bahia - Santo Ant√¥nio de Jesus](https://www.linkedin.com/school/ifba---instituto-federal-da-bahia/), for evaluation and grade definition. The initial question was: choose some data structure (FIFO queue, chained list or tree B) and implement all the logic in a program. I chose tree B and here it is.

Topics you will find:
- Estrutura para inserir dados em arvore B com C#
- Estrutura para deletar dados em arvore B com C#
- Estrutura para consultar/imprimir em console dados em arvore B com C#
- Salvando dados em .TXT com C#
